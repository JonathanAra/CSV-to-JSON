# CSV-to-JSON
Parsing JSON Data from Converted CSV files

# CSV to JSON Converter

This project contains a Python script that converts CSV files to JSON format. It's particularly useful for situations where JSON data is needed from structured CSV files.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to use the script on your local machine. Ensure you have Python installed to run the script.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- CSV file to convert

### Running the Script

1. Place your CSV file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script with the command `python csv_to_json.py`. (Replace with conversion file path)
3. The script will read the CSV file and output a JSON file in the same directory.

## Customization

You can modify the script to accommodate different CSV formats or to change the structure of the JSON output.
